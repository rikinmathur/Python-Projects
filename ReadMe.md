# **Using Python to Predict Loan Default**

Employing the above python file, predict loan default using a Customer Loan Payment History dataset easily avaialable on Kaggle
     
## **Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

- Python 2.7 
- Excel

### Running Predictions

There will be 3 steps in this process. Preparing the Features (Includes visualizations in Seaborn), Preprocessing and Prediction.

#### Step1
Download the Dataset using the following Link:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g22uyq7vz3ff68g/AAAcMBg_2Ee3_pQnnQCoZly9a?dl=0

#### Step2
Make sure you have Python 2.7 install. For Python 3 versions, you will have to tweak the code a bit. I 
suggest running the code in an IDE where you can easily debug the code in sections based on the comments. 

#### Step3
For the predictions part, there are sevral algorithms including SVM, Logistic Regression and Random Forests employed. 
Feel free to play with features and choose the algorithm that fits your preprocessing the best.
